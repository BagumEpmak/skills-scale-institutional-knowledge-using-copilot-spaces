# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

Welcome to OctoAcme's project management documentation hub! This guide provides a central entry point for understanding how we deliver projects from ideation through deployment and continuous improvement.

Whether you're a new team member getting oriented or an experienced contributor looking for a specific process, this README will help you navigate our project management approach and find the detailed documentation you need.

## Project Management Processes Summary

OctoAcme follows a structured yet flexible project management lifecycle designed to deliver customer value iteratively while maintaining quality and clear communication. Here's an overview of our key process stages:

### Initiation
Every project starts with a clear understanding of the problem we're solving and the goals we're aiming to achieve. During initiation, we:
- Create **Project One-pagers** that define the problem statement, objectives, and success metrics
- Align stakeholders on project scope, timeline, and resource needs
- Establish **go/no-go decision gates** to ensure we're working on the right priorities
- Identify initial risks and dependencies

### Planning
Once a project is greenlit, we break down the work into manageable, shippable increments:
- Create **prioritized backlogs** with clear acceptance criteria for each work item
- Define the **Definition of Done** to ensure quality standards
- Map out dependencies between teams and systems
- Identify and document risks that could impact delivery
- Establish sprint/iteration cadences and milestones

### Execution & Tracking
Day-to-day execution is where we build, test, and deliver value:
- Use **project boards** (GitHub Projects, Jira, etc.) to visualize work in progress
- Follow **PR workflows** with code reviews and automated checks
- Conduct quality testing to validate acceptance criteria
- Maintain **team rhythm** with daily standups and weekly syncs
- Track velocity and progress toward milestones
- Establish clear **blocker escalation paths** to keep work moving

### Risk Management & Communication
Proactive risk management and transparent communication keep projects on track:
- Maintain a **risk register** with identified risks and mitigation strategies
- Assess impact and likelihood for each risk
- Use **stakeholder communication templates** for consistent updates
- Follow defined **escalation paths** for critical issues
- Share regular status updates with stakeholders

### Release & Deployment
We follow standardized release practices to ensure smooth, reliable deployments:
- Use semantic versioning with **release types** (patch/minor/major)
- Complete **pre-release requirements** including testing and documentation
- Follow **deployment checklists** to reduce errors
- Have **rollback procedures** ready for quick recovery
- Publish **release notes** to communicate changes

### Retrospective & Continuous Improvement
Learning from experience drives our continuous improvement:
- Capture learnings after sprints, releases, and incidents
- Track **action items** from retrospectives
- Measure the impact of improvements
- Share learnings across teams
- Iterate on processes based on feedback

### Roles & Responsibilities
Clear ownership ensures accountability and smooth collaboration:
- **Project Managers**: Coordinate delivery, manage schedules and risks, facilitate communication
- **Product Managers**: Define outcomes, prioritize backlog, measure success
- **Developers**: Implement features, collaborate on design and testing
- **QA**: Validate quality and acceptance criteria
- **Stakeholders**: Provide inputs, feedback, and approvals
