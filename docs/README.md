# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

## Overview
Welcome to OctoAcme's project management documentation. This collection provides a comprehensive guide to how we plan, execute, and deliver successful projects. Our approach emphasizes customer value, iterative delivery, and continuous improvement through clearly defined processes and roles.

These documents are designed to help team members at all levels understand our project management philosophy, find the right processes for each project phase, and ensure consistent, high-quality delivery across all initiatives.

## How We Work

OctoAcme's project management approach is built on five core principles:

- **Customer-first**: We prioritize customer value and usability in every decision
- **Iterative delivery**: We deliver small, testable increments to enable faster feedback and adaptation
- **Clear ownership**: Each project has a named Project Manager (PM) and Product Lead with defined responsibilities
- **Data-informed decisions**: We measure impact and iterate based on evidence, not assumptions
- **Psychological safety**: We encourage open feedback, learning, and continuous improvement

Our collaborative environment includes regular communication cadence:
- Weekly sync between PM and Product Manager
- Twice-weekly standups for delivery teams (or as agreed)
- Monthly stakeholder updates
- Ad-hoc escalations as needed

## Project Management Processes Summary

OctoAcme uses a structured, iterative approach to project management that ensures consistency while remaining flexible to project needs:

- **Clear problem and goal definition**: Every project starts with a well-defined problem statement and measurable success criteria (Project Initiation)
- **Planning, backlog creation, and risk management**: We define scope, resources, milestones, and proactively identify risks before execution begins
- **Agile execution and progress tracking routines**: Teams build, test, and review iteratively with regular standups and sprint cycles
- **Risk escalation and communication paths**: Clear protocols ensure issues are surfaced and resolved quickly
- **Structured release and deployment workflows**: Standardized processes ensure reliable, safe deployments
- **Retrospective sessions for continuous improvement**: After each project, we capture learnings and actionable improvements
- **Defined roles and responsibilities**: Clear ownership model with PM, Product Manager, Developers, QA, and Stakeholder roles
