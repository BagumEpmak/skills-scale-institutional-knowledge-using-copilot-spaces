# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

Welcome to the OctoAcme project management documentation hub! This collection of guides and resources is designed to help team members understand and follow our project management processes, from initial planning through delivery and continuous improvement.

## Purpose

These documents provide a standardized framework for managing projects at OctoAcme. Whether you're a new team member getting up to speed or an experienced contributor looking for specific guidance, these resources will help you navigate our project lifecycle, understand key roles and responsibilities, and find the right process for each phase of work.

## Project Management Process Overview

OctoAcme follows a **customer-first, iterative delivery model** with clear ownership and data-informed decisions. Our approach balances structure with flexibility, ensuring teams can deliver value predictably while adapting to changing needs.

### Core Principles

Our project management approach is built on these foundational principles:

- **Customer value prioritization**: We focus on delivering features and outcomes that directly benefit our customers and users
- **Iterative delivery of small increments**: We ship small, testable pieces of work frequently rather than large batches
- **Clear role ownership**: Every project has clearly defined roles and responsibilities, with named Project Managers and Product Managers
- **Data-driven decisions**: We measure impact and iterate based on evidence, not assumptions
- **Psychological safety**: We encourage feedback, learning, and experimentation in a blameless culture

### Project Lifecycle Stages

Every OctoAcme project moves through six key stages:

#### 1. Initiation
Validate the problem statement, align stakeholders, and define success metrics. This stage ensures we're solving the right problem before investing in detailed planning.

**Key activities**: Problem validation, stakeholder identification, success metrics definition, go/no-go decision

#### 2. Planning
Break work into shippable increments, create a prioritized backlog, and identify dependencies and risks. This stage translates ideas into actionable work.

**Key activities**: Backlog creation, estimation, release planning, dependency mapping, Definition of Done

#### 3. Execution & Tracking
Execute the plan through daily standups, sprint ceremonies, PR workflows, quality gates, and proactive blocker escalation. This is where the work gets done.

**Key activities**: Daily standups, sprint planning and reviews, code reviews, testing, progress tracking

#### 4. Risk & Communication
Maintain a risk register, provide regular stakeholder updates, and follow clear escalation paths when issues arise.

**Key activities**: Risk identification and mitigation, stakeholder communications, blocker escalation

#### 5. Release & Deployment
Follow standardized deployment checklists, prepare rollback plans, and communicate release notes to stakeholders.

**Key activities**: Pre-release validation, deployment execution, smoke testing, release announcements

#### 6. Retrospective & Continuous Improvement
Hold regular learning sessions after sprints, releases, or milestones, and convert insights into actionable improvements.

**Key activities**: Retrospective meetings, action item tracking, process improvements

### Key Roles

- **Project Manager (PM)**: Coordinates delivery, manages schedules, risks, dependencies, and stakeholder communications
- **Product Manager (PdM)**: Defines outcomes, prioritizes the backlog, and measures success against customer value
- **Developers**: Implement features, collaborate on design, and ensure testability and quality
- **QA/Testing**: Validate quality standards and verify acceptance criteria are met
- **Stakeholders**: Provide input, feedback, and approvals throughout the project lifecycle

### Core Artifacts

- **Project Charter / One-pager**: Defines the problem, goals, and success metrics
- **Roadmap**: High-level view of planned initiatives and their timelines
- **Backlog**: Prioritized list of work items with acceptance criteria
- **Risk Register**: Tracks identified risks, their impact, and mitigation plans
- **Retrospective Notes**: Captures learnings and action items for continuous improvement
